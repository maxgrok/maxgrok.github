## Introduction

In this post, I'm going to introduce the basics of gamification as discussed in Gabe Zichermann's 2010 talk, "Fun is the Future" and explored in the beginning of the Gamification course on Udemy (Level 1). I'll talk about what gamification is, as well as why it's relevant -- now more than ever -- to know about it.

## Games

I love games. I waited 10+ years for Diablo III to come out and played it on Switch, after a long haitus of gaming. It was fantastic. I operate as a warrior/paladin and get to slay zombies and other monsters on an epic quest. Whenver I'm gaming, I feel a sense of challenge and accomplishment. I get into flow. I love the time I spend gaming and gain more self-efficacy by doing it. Through gaming, I learned resilience, but that's another story. 
Bottom line, as Gabe Zichermann points out, games benefit their creators, i.e. the house. Diablo III has eaten hours of my life, but I feel grateful for the journey spent gaming. However, corporate loyalty programs of the 1980s show the more dishonest side of gaming really directly. The redemption of airline points is not easy or desirable for the airline, yet they give out loyalty points. This loyalty program is not built to deliver the rewards, rather to calculate very specific data about its customers. This game benefits the creator of the game, namely - in this case - the airline. Ultimately, the creators of Diablo III benefited because I bought their game and played it for hours on end with a satisfying experience.

## Mechanics of Engagement

Increasingly, the startup metrics of DAU/MAU (Daily Active Users / Monthly Active Users) are not good measurements of engagement in a product, much less a game. They aren't holistic and only point to when the user is on the site. What does this have to do with gamification? Engagement is the key metric for any product, including games, these days; it's core to have a long-term relationship with your users. Instagram, Facebook, etc. all have methods of engaging users continuously throughout their lifecycle of the their product.

Whether through notifications, likes, or a leaderboard, they deliver the challenge, achievement, and reward cycle commonly seen in games. This releases a bit of dopamine for the user and keeps them on the application for a longer period of time. In 2010, Zichermann cites a study that shows 80% of people use a second screen on top of TV/streaming screens, as if they need a distraction from the distraction (TV/streaming). There is no reason to believe this trend has receded in the present either. This translating to web applciations means that people's attention span is less than 10 seconds of focused time to figure out what a website does, and whether or not they want to use it.

## Why is this important?

This is important because increasingly engagement dictates who is 'successful' and who is not; who captures their user's attention and who churns. Attention translates to money. Money translates to successful businesses/web applications. 

So, it is important that web application developers are aware of game mechanics because their company/client may ask them to build in badges to user profiles - for example - without a larger context of why the badges and how they are distributed. This is NOT proper gamification. 

Technically, this may not be difficult to add a badge by itself to a web app, however, if the client/company wants to achieve the potential >30% increase in key engagement metrics, then they will need to be aware that there is more to it than just having a badge on a site. They will need to know the overall cycle of how to create challenge-achievement-reward cycles that are easily completed to rope in users on on-boarding.

## How it all ties together: 'Fun is the Future', so is Crypto

I'm a big believer in crypto's, specifically Ethereum's, ability to convert our usual zero-sum game into prosocial collaborations. We, as a community, need to be extra careful about the games we are building with tokens embedded in commmunities to ensure the healthy mutual gain of both user and creator. Flipping 'the house always wins' on it's head to the house perhaps always overlaps with user wins, creating win-win games.
