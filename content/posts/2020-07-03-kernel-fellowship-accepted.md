I'm proud to announce that I've been accepted into the <a href="https://gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-kernel/">KERNEL Fellowship</a>'s Genesis Block run by Gitcoin. Starting next week, this 8 week incubator program will help guide us through building web3 products and is run by the best of web3. We'll also connect to more mentors, friends, and the general web3 community. I'm honored and looking forward to diving in deep, fast.<br/>

As my KERNEL project, I will be building a proof of concept for <a href="http://www.delance.app/">DeLance</a> and ushering in the future of freelancing in this new normal.

If you are interested in getting involved, and are a web3 engineer, let me know! Likewise if you have any questions about the fellowship or DeLance, let me know!
